# ChattingBots

## Description

Welcome to ChattingBots! This project allows you to create conversations between AI bots playing any roles you wish.

For instance, have Socrates and Tom Cruise engage in a deep debate about the meaning of life. Or maybe, you'd prefer to hear what they had for breakfast?
